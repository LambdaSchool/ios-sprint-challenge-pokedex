# MVP Checklist

## Requirements

The requirements for this project are as follows:

1. Establish a Pokemon record with properties for the Pokemon's name, ID, ability, and types.
 2. Display a list of matching Pokemons and show the sprite (image) associated with the record. (There will only be one, however.)
3. Allow the user to save the Pokemon. Display a list of saved Pokemons in a table view, including the Pokemon sprites. (Stretch: Implement persistence for this list.)
4. Allow the user to view a Pokemon's information in a detail view controller.
5. Allow users to remove saved items from their Pokemon list. (If you implement persistence as a stretch goal, keep the saved list in sync.)


## Extras
- Have the view change when the user taps to save a search result (pokemon).
- Have the title change to the name of the current pokemon being viewed.
- Resize the pokemon sprites as needed.


## Stretch
1. See embedded stretch goal(s) mentioned within the requirements.
2. Allow the user to search for a Pokemon using partial name matching. You will have to download a full list of the Pokemon names from the API and then perform your searches locally.
3. Sort the Pokemons by their name or ID in the saved pokemon list. Offer the user a toggle that enables them to switch between the two sorts.
